## Executive Summary

This red team engagement simulated a real-world internal network attack against an Active Directory environment.

The assessment demonstrated that a low-privileged domain user could escalate privileges, move laterally across the network, and compromise critical systems due to misconfigurations and weak security controls.

Key risks identified include:
- Excessive Active Directory permissions
- Weak credential hygiene
- Lack of internal network segmentation
- Insufficient monitoring and logging

If exploited by a real attacker, these weaknesses could result in full domain compromise, data theft, and long-term persistence.

## Persistence Mechanisms

### Objective
Maintain long-term access to compromised systems and the Active Directory environment.

### Persistence Techniques Considered
- Scheduled tasks
- Service persistence
- Registry-based persistence
- Active Directory abuse for long-term access

### Observations
- No monitoring on scheduled task creation
- Limited visibility into persistence mechanisms
- Privileged actions were not logged effectively

### Security Impact
Lack of persistence monitoring enables attackers to maintain access even after remediation attempts.

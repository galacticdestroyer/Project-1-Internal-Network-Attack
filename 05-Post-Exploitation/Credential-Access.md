## Credential Access

### Objective
Harvest credentials to enable further privilege escalation and domain dominance.

### Credential Sources
- Memory-resident credentials
- Cached credentials
- Service account credentials
- Kerberos tickets

### Observations
- Privileged credentials were accessible post-escalation
- Kerberos ticket abuse was possible
- Credential hygiene was weak across systems

### Security Impact
Credential exposure enables full domain compromise and persistence beyond detection.
